## FAQ

**1. Why does my tkinter app look a bit different than the design?**

Tkinter is OS-dependent framework. It will look different on different OS. Pyuibuilder provides you a common interface to develop the tkinter application, so it may look a bit different depending on the OS.

**2. How do add citation when I write a research paper?**

For academic purposes, you can cite as follows:
